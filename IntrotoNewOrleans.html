  <h1>So...</h1>
  <hr size="3" noshade>
  <p align="center">In <strong>1682</strong>, a French Explorer name <strong>Lasalle</strong> found a river the natives called the "Mississippi," or "Big River."
    He travels all the way down it to the Gulf of Mexio and realizes he found a super highway through the continent.
    Naturally, he claims that land for France and names it in honor of the current French King, <strong>Louis XIV</strong>.
    He calls it <em>Louis' Land</em> or, <strong>Louisana</strong>.</p>

  <p align="center">
    Lasalle goes back to France and says "Louis, I found this big piece of land in the New World and named it for you. Let's colonize it."
    So, they send a second expledition out in <strong>1699</strong> led by two brothers, the <strong>Le Moyne</strong> brothers.
    The older is named <strong>Iberville</strong> and the younger is named <strong>Bienville</strong> (he is more important to us).</p>
  <p align="center">
    They come up through the Gulf of Mexico and stop in Mobile Bay. Mobile, Al is the first capital of French Louisana. Shortly after, they find the
    mouth of the river and start sending expeditions up river. When they get to a particular bend in the river, Bienville says, "This is a Beautiful
    Crescent on the river, let's stop here." However, Iberville was the governor and didn't want to stop, so they continued further up until Iberville
    found a spot he liked. In order to remember where it was when he came back, Iberville stuck a big <em>red stick</em> in the ground on the shore
    That is now <strong>Baton Rouge</strong>, or "Red Stick," LA.
  </p>

  <p align="center">
    Iberville dies, Bienville becomes the new governor and in the year...
  </p>
  <h1 align="center"><strong>1718</strong></h1>
  <p align="center">
    <strong>Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville</strong> returns to the Beautiful Crescent on the river and founds the settlement of
    <em>Nouvelle-Orléans</em>. In 1718, Louis XIV was dead and his son, Louis XV was only <em>eight years old</em>. So, their cousin by marriage,
    <strong>Phillipe II, Duke of Orléans</strong> was the Regent of France until Louis XV was an adult. We are named for Phillipe II, Duke of Orléans.

  <p align="center">
    The following year in <strong>1719</strong>, the first two slave ships arrive carrying roughyl 250 slaves a piece. That nearly doubles the
    population in a single day. Their labor, the labor of their decendents, and the other slaves transported during the <strong>Trans-Atlantic
      Slave Trade</strong> will build nearly everything in New Orleans before <strong>1863</strong> and emancipation.

  <hr size="2">
  <p align="center">
    We are French from the years <strong>1718 through 1762</strong>. In 1762, Louis XV is an adult, going over the books for the French crown and he
    realizes the French crown is in a pretty tight spot, financially. There were a big list of problems. Two of the more important ones to us:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The Louisana Territory was costing more money to maintain than what they received back from it.</li>
    <li>They were about to lose a war with the <em>British</em>. In America, we call it the <strong>French and Indian War</strong>, but it is really
      a part of the larger <strong>Seven Years War</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="center">
    So, Louis XV approaches his first cousin, <strong>Carlos III</strong> of Spain. He says, "Hey Chuckie, I got a piece of land in the New World
    and I don't want it anymore. If you aid me against the British, I will <em>give you the Louisana Territory</em>." Carlos says, "That's a great
    deal."
  </p>
  <p align="center">So, in <strong>1762</strong>, France and Spain sign the secret <strong>Treaty of Fountainbleau</strong>, handing control of the Territory
    from the French to the Spanish. But they never told the citizens of New Orleans they were now Spanish until 1763 when, <em>surprise,</em> a new
    Spanish government appears on the river. And, the Frenchmen who already lived there, didn't take kindly to the new Spanish government.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    So, they rebel against the Spanish by sending ambassadors to Louis XV declaring how terrible Spanish rule is, begging to be taken back. Louis XV
    upholds the Spanish rule and sends them packing. Fed up with colonial rule, the Frenchmen turn to violence and forcebly kick the Spanish governor,
    <strong>Antonio de Ulloa</strong>, out of Louisana, back to Spain.
  </p>
  <p align="center">In a response, the Spanish sent a new governor. This time, he was an Irish guy; a mercenary in the Spanish army. His name was <strong>Alejandro
      O'Reilly</strong>. When O'Reilly arrives he says, "Hey guys, I've just imported some wine. Let's drink it and we can calmly discuss Spanish
    colonializm." Well, 5 frenchmen arrive for dinner and drinks. They are promptly shot. Their heads are cut off, left on spikes at the downriver
    boundry of the settlement where <strong>Frenchmen St</strong> is today. Today on Frenchmen St, you can listen to music <em>seven nights a week</em>.

  <p align="center">
    So, we are now a Spanish colony from <strong>1762 through 1800</strong>. During that time, the city <em>burns down twice</em> in <strong>1788</strong>
    and <strong>1794</strong>. Because of the two fires, the Spanish's thoughtful and dilligent reaction to rebuilding the city,
    and their influence during the reconstruction, we call the architecture in the French Quarter <strong>Spanish Caribbean</strong>, not French Colonial.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    Meanwhile, on <strong>July 14, 1789, La Fete de la Bastille</strong>, the people storm the bastille and arm themselves. In the middle of <strong>
      The French Revolution</strong>, <strong>Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette</strong> lose their heads. Beheading the Monarchy was a very revolutionary
    thing to do. So, this guy named <strong>Napoleon</strong> takes over France.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    In 1800, Napoleon is working on conquering all of Europe to establish what he will later call <strong>The First French Empire</strong>. When he becomes
    knocking on the door for Spain, the Spanish government says to him, "Don't invade us and we'll <em>give you the Louisana Territory</em>." Napoleon takes
    that deal. However, because of the <strong>Hatian Revolution</strong>, Napoleon had no solid foothold in the new world and couldn't care less about
    New Orleans. So, for <em>three years</em> from <strong>1800 through 1803</strong>, the colony is <em>owned by France</em>, but still controlled by the
    <em>Spanish</em> government already in place.
  </p>
  <img src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/fb/ac/9b/spanish-plaza.jpg" alt="Plaza de Armas under Spanish Control" title="Plaza de Armas under Spanish Control" width="350" class="center">
  <hr size="2">
  <p align="center">
    That is confusing. Let's simplify things. This all leads us to the year <strong>1803</strong>.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>, the third American president, wants to buy the City of New Orleans from Napoleon. That is all he cares about; he only
    wants New Orleans. Because, if you control New Orleans, you control the <em>entire Mississippi River</em>. The Mississippi is the <em>longest river</em>
    on the North American continent. It is the <em>fourth longest river in the entire world</em>. In 1803, there are no planes, trains or automobiles.
    Everyone travels and every good is shipped on the water.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    So, Napoleon says to Thomas Jefferson, "Ok, sure I'll sell you New Orleans. But, you have to take the entire Louisiana Territory in the deal. You can't
    have New Orleans all by itself." Jefferson goes, "Ok, but, there's nothing in the territory, yeah? So it's only worth <strong>$15 million</strong>."
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    The Louisana Territory was much larger than the state of Louisana is today. It stretched from the <em>Gulf of Mexico into present day Canada</em>.
    From the <em>Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountaints</em>. It was roughly <strong>828,000 square miles</strong>. At $15 million, that was
    <strong>$18 for a square mile</strong>. However, that's in 1803 dollars, which is misleading to leave it at that. When you do the adjustment,
    that $15 million is closer to <strong>$250 million</strong>. That is still less than <em>$300 for a square mile</em>. Today all that land is valued
    at <strong>$1.4 trillion</strong>. It's still considered the <em>greatest real estate deal in history</em>.
    Eventually <em>fifteen states</em> were carved out of that land purchased.

  <p align="center">
    Finally, in <strong>1812</strong>, Louisana became the eighteenth state in the Union.
